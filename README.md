# Snake-Project

-----


This project is meant to be a recreation of the classic game snake, both in C++ and Qt. I will first start by coding a simple version of the
game in C++ and then attempting to port to Qt. The user will interact with the game through key presses if possible. The game board itself
and the snake/food will be simple characters in the console version, although hopefull I will be able to upgrade the graphics using Qt
resources. This will allow me to test the logic of my code as well as some Qt implementation practices. I will attempt to use the ui if
possible.

The use of the project is simple:

Simply download the files given and run, preferably through an IDE as I don't have any knowledge of other platforms.

## Current features
--------
- So far, nothing.

## Use of class material
--------
So far, the project uses git functionality, including branching and merging, commits, and remote repositories. If I get to it, it will also
incorporate Qt. As for other sections, I will go into those below.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

### Function Pointers and Functors

### Memory Management

### Templates

### Smart Pointers

### Iterators

### Generic Algorithms, Lambdas, and Bind

## Test Cases and Problems
